# PeopleDectectionCountingSys
People detection and counting system at indoor spaces using computer vision based strategies: 
- Histogram of oriented gradients (HoG)
- SIFT extractor - Fisher Encoding (SIGFT - FV)
- Supported Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN)
- Neuronal Network (ANN)

The following source is the result of a 6 month bachelor degree project about people counting systems using computer vision. The work is summarized as follows:
